#NERP Todo
**Built with NodeJS, Express, Postgres and React/Redux**

Good starting place for any app using the above combination.

**Note: the textfield is VARCHAR(40) so stick to tweet limit.**
*(I'll put in a check for length and maybe a counter later)*

###Takeaways for later reference:

- Node + Express + React/Redux + Postgres, duh!
- Postgres complete CRUD integration.
- Some standard React + Redux stuff.
- Webkit style includes :D.
- Updated todo on blur.
- Mildly unnecessary use of refs and PropTypes.
- Cool delete transition (timed CRUD).
